## Dashdiveâ€™s Self-Service API

It is important to have flexibility and control in managing cloud data. To meet diverse needs, Dashdive offers a couple of methods for capturing cloud events:

1. **Self-Serve APIs**: For users who prefer direct control or need to customize event collection, the self-serve APIs offer the flexibility and granularity needed for specific cloud requirements.

2. **Dashdive SDKs**: For those who want to manually control event collections but would like some uplift from a library ([available upon request](mailto:team@dashdive.com))

This documentation focuses on our Self-Serve APIs, providing you with the tools and knowledge to integrate these APIs into your cloud management workflow.

#### How to Use
