<Note>
  Our onboarding process currently contains manual infraastructure provisioning
  steps. We are working to automate these and release a self-serve offering.
</Note>

1.  **Create an account in the [web dashboard](https://app.dashdive.com).** Behind the scenes, we will subsequently provision infrastructure for your account. Once that is finished, we will send an API key to your email.
2.  **Start collecting events.** You have two options:

    - Collect your cloud usage events manually and send them to our ingestion endpoint directly or via our [SDKs](https://github.com/dashdive/fern/tree/main/generated).
    - Install our agent to collect and tag events automatically in the background. To access builds of the agent, please [reach out](mailto:team@dashdive.com).

3.  **Log into the web dashboard and run queries on the ingested events.** Now you can start getting value out of Dashdive!
