## Introduction

Dashdive breaks down cloud costs by feature, team, and customer, among other attributes of interest. We currently support S3-compatible object storage providers, including AWS, Backblaze and Wasabi. If there is another provider or service you’d like to see supported, please [let us know](mailto:team@dashdive.com).

## Creating your account
Reach out to us at [team@dashdive.com](mailto:team@dashdive.com) to schedule your concierge onboarding. Before this meeting, please track down the following read-only cloud provider credentials:
- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key
- Endpoint: The specific service URL of your cloud storage, which varies based on the provider.

We use these credentials to verify completeness of the data we receive and identify missed events.

## Sending your cloud usage data to our API
Dashdive requires that you send the cloud usage events that you’d like to track to our self-serve API. For information about how to do that, see our [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction).

## Visualizing your cloud usage and costs in our dashboard
Log in to your account at [app.dashdive.com](https://app.dashdive.com/) to visualize and export your cloud usage and cost data.

## A note on security
Your security is our top priority. Dashdive uses your cloud credentials exclusively for authorized and secure data retrieval. We ensure that all credentials are encrypted and stored securely, using industry best practices to ensure complete confidentiality of your data.
