## Welcome to Dashdiveâ€™s Data Collection Solutions

At Dashdive, we understand the importance of flexibility and control in managing cloud data. To meet diverse needs, we offer two distinct methods for data collection:

1. **Automated Agent**: For those seeking a hassle-free, automated solution, our agent seamlessly integrates with your cloud storage, providing efficient and continuous data collection.
   
2. **Self-Serve APIs**: For users who prefer direct control or need to customize data collection, our self-serve APIs offer the flexibility and granularity needed for specific data requirements.

This documentation focuses on our Self-Serve APIs, providing you with the tools and knowledge to integrate these APIs into your cloud management workflow.

## Getting Started with Self-Serve APIs

Before diving into the API details, ensure you're familiar with the basic concepts and setup requirements:

- Review the [API Setup Guide](/s3/introduction) for initial configuration steps.
