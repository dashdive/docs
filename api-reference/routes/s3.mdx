## Body Content

Like all ingestion endpoints, the S3 endpoint accepts a body containing the description of a single event. The event may be one of the event types enumerated below.

Note that fractional seconds in timestamps are allowed but will be ignored, because S3 event timestamps have a maximum granularity of seconds (see [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html#API_GetObject_Examples)). This applies in addition to the timestamp guidelines specified [here](/api-reference/introduction#data-type-considerations).
